# LBMesh Snippets README

This is a basic snippet library for EJS and JS files to be used on Loopback.io Projects.  EJS are used for the views in many parts of the framework.  JS files will be used for controllers, models, etc.  Since there is wide adoption for Visual Studio Code, I built this library of snippets to speed up development using the framework.  I will work fast on enabling enough base functionality to make it useful.  These are mainly core snippets I have used over the past couple of years while this framework idea was still in my mind. 

Please let me know if there are issues with the snippets or other ones that could be built and/or that might be useful.  As of now I am primarily working off Mac, but will test for Windows as well.


## Installation

In order to install an extension you need to launch the Command Pallete (Ctrl + Shift + P or Cmd + Shift + P) and type Extensions. There you have either the option to show the already installed snippets or install new ones. Search for LBMesh Snippets and install it.
